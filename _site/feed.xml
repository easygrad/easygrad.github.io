of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>youngmoney</name></author><category term="부동산" /><category term="부동산" /><category term="경매" /><summary type="html">A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kiwifruit</title><link href="/%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC/2018/08/22/kiwifruit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kiwifruit" /><published>2018-08-22T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2018-08-22T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC/2018/08/22/kiwifruit</id><content type="html" xml:base="/%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC/2018/08/22/kiwifruit.html">&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>youngmoney</name></author><category term="개발" /><category term="파이썬" /><category term="javascript" /><category term="코딩" /><category term="개발" /><summary type="html">Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Apples</title><link href="/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC/2018/08/21/apples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apples" /><published>2018-08-21T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2018-08-21T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC/2018/08/21/apples</id><content type="html" xml:base="/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC/2018/08/21/apples.html">&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
